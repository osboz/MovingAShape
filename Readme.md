# Learning goals

    use struct and union
    explain the trade-offs of using struct vs arrays
    implement self-referencing data structures
    use typedef to shorten struct definitions
    integrate and use an external library


# Problem

We will write a program that generates random sentences based on the book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.
We will create tokens from the text and create a table that tracks which tokens come after which token.

# Requirements

#### 1. You only fill // YOUR CODE HERE parts.

- Changed some names to follow the variable naming convetions i prefer

#### Include example output of your program in your documentation.

###### Examples

> 1. England, you raise the light of brotherly love another?

    - Prepare!

> 2.  Turkey, and accept your persuasions will be at your country chiefly spent in your narrow reflections determined thenceforth became every day s goals and attentions of life?

    - Frankenstein!

> 3.  Alpine summers she stood as he appeared the decline of the creation of life?

    - Excellent friend!

> 4.  French?

    - Remember that was now become sullen in ruin!

> 5.  Immediately upon request, remain in dreams of nature, should be supposed her to be nearly to one corner, near the reflections upon lifeless clay?

    - Angelica she spoke the United States and lead to spend the detail it; and the monster, they were there will meet and put into the knowledge was at least, not found cottagers arose from the interest was too can have his deeds of disappointment; dreams of a kind hangs over the north, at which possessed in the dungeons of infusing life of a more horrible pilgrimage!
